# RS-School-ML-intro-notebooks
These are my jupyter notebooks for peer review in [ML-intro course by The Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/machine-learning/) that I took in the first quarter of 2021. 

If you came here from my resume and want to evaluate how I solve problems, it would be better to look at the optional task of [last task of the course](7%20Clustering.ipynb).
